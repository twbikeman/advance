# Coronavirus misinformation spreads over social media

The novel coronavirus roiling financial markets and prompting travel bans is taking on a life of its own on the Internet, once again putting US-based social media compnaies on the defensive about their efforts to curb the spread of false or dangerous information.

Researchers and journalists have documented a growing number of cases of misinformation about hte virus, ranging from racist explanations for the diseases origin to flase claims about miracle cures. Conspiracy theorists, trolls and cynics hoping to use the panic to boost traffic to their own accounts have all contributed to the cloud of bad information.


It's the perfect intersection of fear, racism and distrust of the government and Big Pharma," said Maarten Schenk, co-founder of the fact-checking site Lead Stories. "People don't turst the official narrative."

The novel coronavirus, shich originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, so far has killed at least 900 peopel and infected over 40,00, which cases in more than 20 countries.

One set of tweets and Facebook posts from US conspiracy theory accounts said drinking bleach could protect against the virus or even cure it.

"Rumors can travel more quickly and more widely than they could" in an era before social media, said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, who has a forthcoming book on the history of disinformation. "That of course lends itself to conspiracies spreading more quickly. They spread more widely and they are more persistent in the sense that you can't undo them.

Some of the Internet traffic and misinfomration has been outright racist against Chinese people and Asians in general. Posts attributing the coronavirus to Chinse culinary practices have blown up, and a review of a new Chinese restaurant in Toronto was swarmed by racist trolls . "There's a lot of misinformatino out there, and some of that can be quite dangerous," Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO's emerging disease unit, said at a press conference in Geneva on Jan 29.

Viruses ahve always sparked fear and misinformation, striking panic as rumors spread and people desperate for information latch onto whater snippets they can find---whether they're true or not. But the advent of social media has supercharged this process, leading to waves of misinformation over elections, mass shootings, plane crashes and natural disasters.

The outbreak is just the latest test of social netowrks' ability to handle the spread of false and dangerous information.

"Early days in an outbreak, there's so much uncertainty. People don't like uncertainty. They want answers," said Timothy Caulfield, a health law processor at the University of Alberta. "Social media is polariztion machine where the loudest voices win," he said.
