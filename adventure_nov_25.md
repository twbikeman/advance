# CLIMBING SYDNEY'S HARBOUR BRIDGE #

## This famous bridge offers incredible views and perhaps a way to conquer your fear of heights ##

The view over Syndey's harbor is postcard-perfect. Yellow ferries and gleaming yachts crisscorss the harbor, surrounded by palms, evergreens and, beyond, the famous beaches of Bondi and Manly. The Opera House, an architectural marvel, is Sydney's Eiffel Tower.

Soaring above it all is a steel arch bridge, the largest and widest of its kind in the world.

## Capitalizing on the climb ##

Two deades ago, a member of the Young Presidents' Organization decided to escort visiting company chiefs on a climb to the top of that bridge to take in the best view in Syndey. He turned it into a business, and more than 3 million people have made the climb.

It is  described not only as an adventure for people willing to pay more than $200, but also as a cure for what ails you, if what ails you is a fear of heights.

I admit to some nervousness as two friends and I apporached our appointment for a climb earlier this year. We had chosen the "twilight climb," beginning just before 6 p.m. I don't like heights, but I agreed to go along.

## Gearing up for an adventure ##

When the evening of the climb arrived, we checked in at the southern end of the bridge. Each climbing group is limited to 12, with a guide. We began by filling out legal release forms, not exactly confidence-inspring, but a feature of our modern world.

We changed into blue Star Trek-like jumpsuits and were outfitted with harnesses and a circular plastic device to hook to the guy wires on the bridge. We put on headlampsand tied hankerchief around our wrists to ward off flop sweat. We climbed sets of steep steel stairs indoors to get a feel for what we were about to face. Finally, we were each given a wireless headset so we could hear our leader on the bridge.

Our band emerged onto long, narrow wooden planks--already 30 feet or so above street level--and started our march n the span, beginning with walk along a catwalk above the passing traffic.

We eventually arrived at the spot over the water where the bridge begins begins it upward arch. We climbed four steep ladders, about 25 rungs in all, to reach the starting point for the sairway that would take us to the summit.

As we climbed the arch to the top, I tried to recall the instructions I'd read online: Don't llok down, and breathe. I found myself holding my breath anyway and began thinking, "Is this supposed to be fun?" But I kept climbing, hooked to the steel guy wire by a piece of plastic that I doubted would support my weight if I ended up dangling over the water.

## Sights to behold ##

My friends, happily oblivious to the danger, chattered with our guide Adam about how high we were, and the guide kept pointing out sights in the water--way down below.

At the summit, the view across the harbor was captivating. A sea plane passed just 50 feet overhead. Birds flew well below us. We could see the beaches beyond the harbor and planes taking off from the airport eight miles away.

We turned left to walk across the top of the bridge, pausing to watch the giant orange sun make a stunning 10-minute plunge beneath the water.

## Reaching the end ##

After reaching the lower level, we again walked along a catwalkwith clear views of the passing traffic below on onde side and water on the other.

We were finally back, about theree hours after people like to talk about all the folks who conquer their fear of heights on the journey.

Is the Bridge Climb a cure fore a lifelong fear of heights? Perhaps. But I'm not sure I'd do it again.
