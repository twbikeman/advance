# Achieving personal growth

Getting to the point where ypu're ready to start upgrading to you2.0 isn't easy. But it doesn't mean dropping the ball everywhere esle. It's not about omissions. Come clean with yourself to kick-start your personal growth.

## Unstuck starts with "u"

No one overtly choose to stop learning and growing again, it just kind of happens in the deluge of daily responsibiliteis (and life). And if it were easy to just kick it into gear again, you would have already done it. But the truth is inescapable. If you want to get off that plateau to higher ground, it's up to you and only you. No one will just hand you a steady stream of opportunities for growth.

## You've been working in your life, not on it

Activity is often confused with acceleration. I was gulty of this for years in corporate--staying incessantly busy but not admitting I was bored. I was lost in activity and not stepping bqack to take time to question what I wanted my life to be. Once I began working on my life--quitting corporate, becombing an entrepreneur, restructuring my life--I started growing once again. And I've nver been happier.

## Things aren't happening to you, they're happening for you

A victim mentality is the mortal enemy of personal growth. Lamenting over everything that has gone wrong in your life only saps energy from working to make more things go right. If you want ot kick-start growth, you must view setbacks as having a purpose,  and htne put htme in their place. The past shouldn't run or define you --only fuel you.

## "If only ..." is corrosive

Here's the truth. Things are rarely exactly the way the should be. Wishing and waiting for them to be so is folly. As a mentor once told me, "If only you'd drop this sentiment, you'd start growthing."

## The perfect time ot start doesn't exist

I had som many things that had to be just right before I  could make my long-planned leap form corporate. I'd tell myself, "I'd love to go for it right now, but practically speaking ..." Well, guess what? Practicality is poison. It's th econveninet excuse holding you back form what you're meant to become.

Gorwth doesn't happen withut some level fo risk. And yet caution rules over courage. Here's the ironic part. Research published in the Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning indicates that we consistently overestiamte the consequences of taking a risk, while disdiscounting the cost of status quo. So avoid catastrophizing and don't underestimate the cost to your growth of choosing note to take chances. Risk-taking is a skil that must be built. So get building.

## It's time to unplug other's opinions

Grow where you want to grow. Learn what you want to learn. Wherever you are on the scale of what you want to learn next--be it novice or near-expert--own it, be proud of it. Pretenses are for pretenders. You're just trying to become a better version of your genuine self.

## Good is the enemy of great

I definitely fell into a cycle of feeling that good was good enough in my life, that I should probably feel fortunate to have a good job, to be good at that job and to have done good things. That is good and all. But it isn't great.

Have a clear picture of what great looks like for you, map ut what it takes to get there and start investing in yourself once agian. It's time for sky's the limit thinking. It's time to get growthing going.
