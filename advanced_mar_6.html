<h1>Musical Wonders</h1>

<h2>Meeting the millennials who's keeping player pianos alive</h2>

<p>The first thing you notice at Nate Otto's house is the hearse in the driveway, a 1967 Oldsmobile 98 with tattered curtains and a rusted body. Inside is small, 100-year-old reed organ built for church. It holds a 1970s-era device: a row of mechanical fingers controlled by signals recorded on a cassette tape deck.</p>

<p>It's just a hint of what's in Otto's yard, house and garage: self-playing, old-style musical robots called player pianos. Some sound and look as good as they did a century ago. Some are awaiting repair. Some are being sacrificed for their parts.</p>

<p>Otto, a 29-year-old, has decided that it's his job to bring player pianos back to life.</p>

<p>"I feel obligated to keep things going," he said.</p>

<p>'The soul of an artist'</p>

<p>As the owner and sole employee of Rum River Restoration, Otto believes he's the only full-time player piano restorer in the state of Minnesota. He specializes in Jazz Age relics that once were ubiquitous inAmerica but now are largely forgotten except by collectiors and the rare appreciators of nostalgia, music and mechanical ingenuity.</p>

<p>Otto is a millennial who believes in doing things the old-fashioned way, a purist who strives to make player piano restorations as authentic as possible.</p>

<p>Before he got into player pianos, Otto repaired small engines. But he's a mechanic with the soul of an artist.</p>

<h2>Musical computers</h2>

<p>Otto views the player pianos that he fixed as kinetic art pieces, steampunk mechanical wonders.</p>

<p>Player pianos use an early system of automation similar to perforations in paper or punch cards once used to control calculating machines.</p>

<p>"The player piano is basically one of the earliest home computers," said Rnady Hammond, who has hired Otto to repair some of the player pianos he owns.</p>
