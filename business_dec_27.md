## Melinda Gates and other successful female executives offer career advice

## The two surprising traits all great leaders share, according to Melinda Gates

Melinda Gates' new book The Moment of Lift is out. The result is a whole lot of interesting insights and a few  gems about her personal life and beliefs.

In a lengthy conversation with Business Insider (BI), Gates shares how she, her famous spouse and their kids still do the dishes together each night and explains how seeing Bill Gates drop off his kids at school inspired more dads to also do the school runs.

But even more surprising is Gates' comments on what it takes to be a great leader.

## All you need is ... love?

Gates explains to BI's Alyson Shontell that when she first got to Microsoft the culture was very macho and aggressive.

How did she come to terms with competitive culture? In short, by leaning into her own leadership style.

"I finally decided, instead of of leaving, which was my plan, that I would just be myself and see if I could still be successful. And I ended up attracting all kinds of people from all over the company," she says.

The essence of that style boils down to two surprising words: empathy and love.

"I believe in being compassionate to everybody around you. Whether you talk about love explicitly or not, I think it's what you do to role model. So when you have the employee who has a death in their family or has a loved one who's ill or a young child they're caring for, I think it's in how you respond to them ... that shows your humanity," she explains.


When you show empathy and kindness , it allows employees to trust you and be vulnerable. And that's what drives beyond-the-call-of-duty performance.

"The more we let everybody be themselves, the more we will have empathic leadership. And to me that ultimately is when you reach out and connect with somebody over their humanity. That ultimately is love, whether you name it or not," Gates says.

## Lessons from women pioneers on how to break through ceilings-and keep surprising

The business side of professional sports is the toughest industry for most women. But that doesn't mean women can't navigate through the executive ranks. It's often just more of a challenge.

Here is a look at two women who have risen to the top of their respective jobs in professional sports. They share what they have learned about breaking ceilings.

1. Dont' worry about being "different"

Michele Roberts is the executive director for the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). The former trial lawyer is the first woman to hold the position in the country.

Her advice: "Being different does not mean being inferior." being unique and not offering the same thing as everyone else. Use your strengths rather than push them down. That will be the reason people remember you and your business.

2. Always crave knowledge

Kim Ng currently serves as senior vice president for baseball operations in Major League Baseball and is the highest ranking woman in the sport.

Ng has been quoted as saying, "if you want something, you have to be aggressive ," and that attitude , no doubt, explains her wide expertise in all aspects of baseball operations--from salary arbitrations to player development. She has "an insatiable appetite for understanding why things work," according to an ESPNW.com profile. The lesson here: be an expert in all phases of your business and constantly strive to learn and acquire new knowledge.

## My take

I have found that it's important not to allow yourself to be walked on, but don't come off like a "man." It's important to protect your unique qualities as a female business leader.
