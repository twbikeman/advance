# Unique Ways to Travel

Two men with a love of adventure choose  two usual modes of transportation

Jared  Munich is a bona fide adventure junkie, so it's not surprising he's taking a trip from Brighton Beach in Duluth, Minnesota, bound for James Bay on the Arctic Ocean.

He'll be paddling there--on a stand-up paddleboard (SUP).

Munch will paddle along the North Shore of Lake Superior from Duluth to the Michipicoten River in Ontario, about 490  miles away if you hug the lake's shoreline. He'll then paddle up the Michipicoten, portage over to the Missanabie River, then paddle down the fast-flowing Missanabie to James Bay, another 430 miles on rivers.

He expects to cover the 920 miles "in about a month," Munch told the News Tribune. That's an average of more than 30 miles per day, with gear and provisions lashed to his SUP.

"I've always wanted to paddle to the ocean," Munch said.

He'll be arranging ahead of time for provisions to be dropped off at specific sites. He'll be paddling to be dropped off at specific sites. He'll paddling alone along Lake Superior. His dad, Bill, will join him on the river portion of the trip .

Munch is again hoping to raise money form donations for this trip. But it's not pay for his trip expenses: It's to raise money for Neighborhood Youth Services outdoor programming for kids.

"I would never ask anyone to pay for my fun," Munch said, nothing he has save money for several years to cover the cost of paddling to the sea. While building his bank account, he's also been building his body.

"I have spent a lot of time in the weight room over the past year to get ready for this. ... I have done a lot to imporve my paddling skills since my last journey around the lake," Munch said in assessing his upcoming trip.

## Oregon man rides 1,600 miles along the Baja Divide on a unicycle

Jack Mahler was asked if he got any strange looks when he crossed the United States-Mexico border on a unicycle.

"Well, I get funny looks pretty much everywhere I go, so ..." Mahler responded.

Yes, most folks take a second glance when they see somebody riding a unicycle. But riding 1,600 miles along the Baja Divide on a unicycle is something else altogether.

Mahler, 26, completed the route in 50 days (45 days of riding and five rest days).

Mahler, a landscaper who has free time during the winter, downloaded a GPS file from bajadivide.com that he could use to stay on the route. He started in San Diego and then rode up into the Otay Mountains before descending to the border crossing the Tecate, Mexico. He carried food and water in a backpack and in a saddlebag fashioned to the seatpost his unicycle. For camping at night, he used a bivouac with a sleeping bag and foam pad.


What stands out most in his memory are the mesmerizing sunrises and sunsets in Baja.

"One section by the Pacific was a big salt flat that was super firm," he recalled. "It was 360-degree views because it was so flat. There was a lagoon to one side and the Pacific on the other. It was this big expanse with the sky just lighting up."


Mahler encountered all sorts of cacti and used a tubeless tire to help prevent punctures. He broke several spokes along the way, but his unicycle stayed intact to the end.

He said he saw lots of coyotes, wild horses, lynx and only one rattlesnake.

Mahler averaged about 35 miles per day of unicycling, which required about 10 hours per day.

"I like exploring on the unicycle because I feel like it's a good speed to see things," Mahler said. "It's a nice middle ground between hiking and biking."
