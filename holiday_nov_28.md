In the workplace, well-being is a crucial topic when it comes to preventing employee burn-out and pormoting engagement. Beyond the reserach that shows that employees who are shown that they are appreciated are more porductive by 50 percet, caring for your employees' well-being is simply the right thing to do. Providing programs that support managing life's everyday challenges, offering fitness classes or impolementing flexible work schedules are just a few things that, when paired with gratitude, can lead to more productive, engaged and happier working professionals.

## Gratitude makes us more self-aware ##

Working in an ever-evolving, fast-paced industry, I am surrounded by ambitious people who are always striving for more and better. Gratitude challenge you to reflect in the moment instead of always thinking about the future. It starts by paying attention to what's going on in your life, and that true self-awareness is a key ingredient to being successful in your career.

## Gratitude helps build strong relationships ##

Gratitude is a powerful tool for strengthening relationships, both at work and in your personal life. People who express their gratitude tend to be more willing to forgive others and therefore able to crate long-lasting connections.

During my month-long sabbatical, I made it a point to be reflective during the tiem I had without distractions or deadlines. Part of that was taking a mental inventory ofthe people, things and experiences I as grateful for in my life. I decided to reach out to my fifth-grade teacher and thank her for being a positive mentor and a strong influence on my life.

The old saying goes "It's never too late to say you're sorry," but the same is true of gratitude. Taking the time to thank peoole for their work, kindness or empathy--whether it was today, last month or many years ago--makes you happier, healthier and more self-aware. And that's a gift worth celebrating 365 days a year.
