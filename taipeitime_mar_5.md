# Mobile app downloads surge due to COVID-19 outbreak

The number of downloads of games and apps has surged in China recently, as tens of millions  of people are confined by the COVID-19 outbreak to their homes. More than 222 million downloads were made in China through Apple's online store in the first week of February, and app downloads during the first two weeks of the month jumped by 40 precent.

"Millions of workers and students leveraged mobile apps to seek alternative methods to resuem daily activities remotely," said mobile data provider App Annie. Since schools in many Chinese cities have remained closed and are not expected to reopen soon, downloas of various education apps are particularly popular as schools promote online learning.  

Meanwhile, as the world confronts the spread of the coronavirus, interest in disease-themed films, TV series and games has exploded, with worried viewers turningt to documentaries and disaster movies for answers and ways to cope, according to AFP. A blast of disaster flicks from the past are storming the download charts.
