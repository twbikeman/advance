# If the world is running out of fresh water, why aren't we desalinating more ocean water?

Salty oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth's surface, while fresh water becomes increasingly scarce due to human overpopulaion and climate change. Gobally some 700 million people lack access to clean water while droughts are the norm in many regions.

Stepping up desalinaion---that is, filtering salt out of seawater to maek it potalbe---seems like an obvious solution. But the two most common techniques---reverse osmosis, pushing seawater through membrances to separate the salt, and distillation, boiling seawater and coolecting the resulting salt free water vapor---require costly amounts of energy and infrastructure. They also create a lot potentially toxic "brine" as waste that can kill crops and other vegetation and render groundwater too saline to drink, not to mention negatively alter the chemistry of the ocean. Currently the world's 18,000-plus desalination plants pump 140 billion liters of brine into terrestrial holding pits or back into the ocean every day.


## Alternative method

Ngai Yin Yip and his team of environmental engineers at Columnbia University think their alternative method---"temperature swing solvent extraction" (TSSE)---can fix the problems of leftover brine, in turn making the desalination process cleaner and mor efficient. TSSE uses a solvent that reacts to inexpensive low-grade heat to extract fresh water as efficient as reverse osmosis or distillation at a fraction of the cost.

## A focus on conservation

But even alternatives like these may be less desirable than leaving ocean water alone and focusing instead on conservation and recycling of existing freshwater supplies. The nonprofit Pacific Institute reports that stepping up conservation and efficiency measures already in place in water-wise regions like California could reduce annual water use in urban areas by as much as 57 percent. Meanwhile, recycling (and treating) fresh water and making a bigger effort to capture storm water run-off could produce enough drinking water to quench Los Angeles' thirst two times over.

Given the magnitude of problem, we need to embrace all forms of increasing our supplies of fresh water, whether they involve old-school methods like recycling or newfangled approaches like techonology-enabled desalination.
