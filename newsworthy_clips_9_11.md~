Chimp champ Jane Goodall enlists advanced mapping technology for nature and humanity

In ground-breaking research beginning nearly 60 years ago, Jane Goodall has devoted her to understanding chimpanzees.

Goodall, 85, lived among chimps in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, gathering observations that reached the public in a series of popular books. She depicted how chimps live in societies, in peace, conflict and even war.


Now the English primatologist has enlisted a provider of 21st-century mapping science to understand and protest nature and help their human neighbors thrive alongside wildlife without conflict.

Geographic Information System CGIS) provider Esri will provide the Jane Goodall Institute GIS-software tools to document natural and human resources, including wildlife reserves, towns and flood-control areas. The institute, fellow scientists and local volunteers will collect the information and, with Esri's help, use that knowledge to refine their conservation efforts.

Esri's software puts data into visual formats that people can more easily interpret. Patterns that might not be obvious from a list of numbers leap out form a map. City, stat and federal governments, companies and nonprofits buy Esri's software for that purpose.

Goodall said a major goal of the institute is to prevent or end conflict between wildlife and the welfare of people living nearby.

For the safety of chimpanzees such as those she studies in Tanzania, willing cooperation with villages is essential, and Esri is already helping, Goodall said.

"we began with 12 villages and we're now up to 104," Goodall said. "Most of the chimpanzees in Tanzania are not protected. They're not in any of the parks or reserves. They're just in villages or forest reserves where they are not protected at all."

Volunteers in those villages are working with the institute because they understand that protecting the environment helps people, too, Goodall said.

Goodall and Esri President Jack Dangermond urged the public to get involved in conservation, at whatever level they can.

"I don't care whether it's gardening or working in a factory," Dangermond said. "Everyone can do something."
