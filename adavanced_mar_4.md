# College students face the challenges of managing chronic health conditions by themselves

nathan Reilly has had Type 1 diabetes sinice he was a baby. And until recently, the 19-year-old always had his mother to help remind him of the litany of tasks people with diabetes must do: check blood sugar; adjust insulin pump; watch what you eat; be carful how much you run around.

Now a freshman at Pennsyvania State University, Reilly feels confident he can manage on his own. He spent much of his senior year of high school practicing the routine, preparing.

But of course he still worried a little.

A few times in high school, during hockey season, Reilly fell asleep with low blood sugar and experienced a seizure overnight. The experience was scary, but at least his mom was there to take care of him.

Now living in a dorm room, if his blood sugar is low ehen he tests before bed, Reilly plans to stay awake until it comes up.

## The effect on university students

Diabetes disterss--which is different from regular stress and anxiety---is high among college students and can negatively affect their quality of life, according to a small survey-based study on Ohio. "this is a population we need to focus on in terms of addressing their health outcomes," said Elizabeth A. Beverly, an assistant professor of medicence at Ohio University and the study's lead author. "If you're not controlling your diabetes ... for even four years, that can have a major impact in terms of complications down the road."

## Necessary lifestyle changes

Diabetes distress is a negative emotional reaction to the experience of living with condition that requires around-the-clock attention and lifestyle changes.

People with Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune conditon in which the body does not produce insulin , must diligently track their blood sugar levels and thier carb  intake and administer insulin. People with Type 2 diabetes, where insulin production is compromised, may also need to adhere to nutrition guidelines and take medication.
