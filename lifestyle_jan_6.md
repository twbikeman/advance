# Harboring Secrets and Neglecting Sleep

## Kepp ing secrets and pulling all-nighters can be dangerous for your health

## Secrets are bad for your health

I grew up in a Midwestern town where the prevailing wisdom was to only talk about what was pleasant and keep secrets, if necessray, to mke that happen.


This meat staying mum when someone offended you, rarely vocalizing negative feelings and smileing a tad more than is necessary. It also meant zero room for airing any sort fo dirty laundy, especially not the kinds of personal secrets that keep people up at night.

Many of us like to believe that sweeping unpleasant truths under the rug might make them eventually go away. Instead, keep ing secrets--espceailly heavy ones--can  spin an even more complicated web of isolation and deception. So why do we do it?

The truth can hurt. But in many situations, it's better to get it out and let the healing start, rather than allowing it become more toxic.

The buren of holding in the trught doesn't just disappear. It lurks in the back of your mind and can cause a number of disruptions to your life and health.

"If the situations in your daily life are regular reminders of the secret, and you find it stressful to keep it, then yes, it can have emotional and physical consequences," says Dr. Dean McKay.

"Some people also find keeping secrets stressful out of a general concern they will 'slip,' and this frequent and recurring thought of the secret can in itself be stressful."


This difficulty is especially compounded if you feel trapped by the secret, or if it brings up other negative feelings like guilt, shame or anxiety.

"If the secret is stigmatizing ... or if it feels like you would no tbe accepted if people knew your secret, it can create shame. If the secret is a big part of your identity or who you are, it can lower your sense of self-worth," says Dr. Kristine Chapleau, a psychotherapist at Indiana University Health.

If you do decide that your secrets are inhibiting your capacity for joy and world, and if that secret doesn't put other peoplel in phsyical danger, there are healthy ways to share it.


## Releasing the pressure

There's no guaranteeing that getting the secret off your chest will feel good right in the moment, but there's something to be said for the catharsis of it, and odds are that you'll ultimately be glad you did it.

Choose your initial audience wisely.

"You can talk about (your secret), but be judicious," Chapleau says. "Pick somebody whom you know to be understanding or supportive, or talk to a psychologist or counselor."

Sharing your secret anonymously can also sometime offer a relief, but it's important to make sure you're turly anonymous.

If the issue is more about coming to terms with the secret in your own mind, consider unburdening yourself by writing it out.

"Sometimes the hardest person to tell a secret to is yourself," Chapleau says. "We can have trouble admitting a secret to ourselves. Take additction, for example. The first person you have to admit it to is yourself, and it can lower your self-esteem. Doing so helps you to accept yourself and work to imporve.

## Living free
NO matter what the secret is about, being honest with yourself is the first step to feeling better.

The most important thing to remember is that you're not the sum of your secrets. Even if you're harboring something that feels big and scary, letting it out will help away its power.

If you feel like you're drowning in the pressure of it, a good therapist can help you sort through things. While every situation is different, in many clases you'll find that when the truth does come out, it's actually a much smaller deal to other than you expetectd.

## The unproductive outcome of pulling all-nighters

You;ve got a deadline coming u, so you think to yourself, "I'll just stay up all night to finish. What's the worst that could happen?"

Supprisingly--a lot.

After just one night without sleep, you body feels it. I spoke to experts to find out the exact damage one harmless little all-nighter can actually do.


## Sleep is a memory machine

"In a nutshell, sleep consolidates memory; a lot of the information you take in while you're awake is processed while you're sleeping," say Dr. David GReuner of NYC Surgical Associates.


"Not only your memory is affected, but your ability to solve problems is also hndered, in addition to your alertness, attention, concentration and judgement. Your brain isn't as efficient as it should be."

At 2013 study from UC Berkeley found that during sleep, your memories are essentially moved form short-term holding to long term storage. When you get poor quality sleep, those memories dont' move to the prefrontal cortex for storage adn they're forgotten.

## Circadian rhythm

The circadian rhythm is your body's cycle that tells it when to wake up, go to sleep and perform many other functions.

"You body relays 'messages' to your hypothalamus all day long, which then sends out the hormones that make you feel tired, hungry etc.," explains Dr. Greuner. "If you stay up all night, these messages are out of whack, making you feel downright terrible."

So, you'll not only feel tired, but you'll be hungry, achy and moody.

## How to recover

"If you must pull an all-nighter, try not ot get through the day solely on excess caffeine. Drink plenty of water, eat healthy and try to sneak in a short nap, if possible," says Dr. Greuner.

After staying up all night, it's important to get back to regular sleep schedule as quickly as possible. If you feel a little off for a few days, it's just you body getting back to normal.
