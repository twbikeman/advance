## Minecraft: training leaders of the future? ##

Video games often come under fire for their violent and potentially addictive properties. But a new study from UC Davis researcher and a Swiss colleague has found that they can have their benefits.

UC Davis researcher Seth Frey and Swiss scholar Robert W. Sumner studied users of the online game "Minecraft," in which players build structures, creations and artwork by breaking three-dimensional blocks. The game has nearly 65 millions users and is "one of a few games with a decentralized, amateur-driven hosting model and a large user base," UC Davis spokeswoman Karen Nikos-rose said in a press release.

## Research and findings ##

For their study, Frey and Sumner scanned the Internet every two hours to visit and observe 150,000 "Minecraft" communities to see how the "virtual world" teaches leadership and community-building skills that they may be able to apply in real-world domains.

Of those thousands, they found 1,800 who were successful in creating "self-governing internet communities," Nicos-Rose said in the press release.

Nineteen of every 20 communities failed, she said, but the few that succeeded demonstrated advanced leadership skills. They chose system of governance and installed bits of software to implement regulations such as "private property rights, peer monitoring, social hierarchy, trade and many others," Nikos-Rose said.

## More than a game? ##

"Picking from an a la carte menu of rule types, players assemble highly variable and individualistic forms of government," Frey said in the release. "Although there a trend in what makes an effective government, especially among the largest communities, one of the major surprises of the study is the diversity of systems that prove viable."

While more research is still needed, Frey noted that government skills learned in "Minecraft" may be transferrable to real-world environments by bring "community-building closer and giving a lot more people experience with leadership and governance and feelings of responsibility to a community."

## L.A. theater to experiment with "ambient" movie theater technology ##

Faced with greater competition, movie theaters have tried multiple experiments to upgrade the cinematic experience, including bigger and brighter screens and rumbling seats. But a major challenge for exhibitors is to make the experience more enticing without resorting to gimmickry.

One Los Angeles theater, Regal L.A. Live, is experimenting with an idea that executives say strikes the right balance between so-called enhancement and sensory overload.
 The downtown Los Angeles multiplex plans to introduce immersive multi-screen cinema technology, thanks to a deal between L.A. Live developer AEG and French theater circuit CGR Cinemas.

 ## Reinvention ##

 The revamped 190-seat Regal auditorium will feature a traditional screen at the front, like any other theater. But the audience will also be flanked by five LED screens on each side that will flood moviegoers' peripheral vision with lights and colors based on what's playing on the main screen.

 For example, if you're watching a scene that takes place in the African desert, the LED panels might shower the audience with ambient hues of sky-blue, sun-like yellow and billowing tan sand. But, crucially, viewers won't have to turn their necks to catch any additional onscreen action.

 "When you're watching the movies, you actually feel very immersed into the film," said Shelby Russel, a senior vice president at L.A. Live. "It enhances the mood of each of the scenes."

 ## The success ##

 CGR launched the concept known as ICE (Immersive Cinema Experience) in France about 3 years ago, the company said. The initiative was successful, and ICE Immersive accounted for 75% of CGR's box office revenue in 2018, according to the film. Thirty-two of CGR's 680 auditoriums are now ICE theaters.

 Jocelyn Bouyssy, managing director of CGR Cinemas and ICE Theaters, said the success of ICE theaters in France, where it competes with Imax, bodes well for its U.S. expansion.

 "The problem with other formats is that they distract moviegoer from the film," Bouyssy said through a tranlator. "ICE appeals to a very large audience."
