## A look at one special shelter dog and animal shelter problems

## A hyper shelter dog and a boy with epilepsy

An epilepsy diagnosis at age 9 changed Parker Rogers' life drastically. The Fresno boy was having seizures almost daily. He nolonger could attend public school, and his time with friends was limited. Then, Parker met "Toby the Great."

THe yellow Labrador didn't took promising at first. Lbrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno had scoop him up form a local shelter. Parker's mother, Mandy Rogers, recalls a thin, hyper, dirty dog. She was convinced this was not to be their dog. But of all the dogs available that day, Parker wanted Toby. And so the Lab joined the Rogers family.

Shortly after aking him home, Toby taught himself how to detect his boy's seizures befor they happened.

It startled Mandy Rogers the first time Toby tried to help. He was jumping on Parker, nipping at his mother's hands and trying to herd the family into one room.

Mandy called a dog trainer for advice, worried about this strange, erratic behavior. Then Parker had a seizure. It turned out Toby was trying get Parker to sit down because he could sense a seizure coming and was trying to alert Mandy.

Since then, Toby has learned how to fetch emergency seizure medication for Paker. He'll also run to get Parker's mom when a seizure is coming on. If Parker is sitting down when a seizure is about to happen, Toby sits on the boy and doesn't let him stand up.

Parker says Toby helps him feel safe and secure. Along with being a friend, the dog has given him the confidence to be more independent.


"I could finally sleep in my room alone, just me and Toby," Parker said. "I can go out and ride my bike, just me and Toby. Toby's life changed, too. He went form being a stray dog, to a rescue, to the most important part of my medical team."
"Our family rescued Toby," Parker says, "but he really rescued me."

## Opinion: Animal shelters, a refuge for strays or a pet boutique?



Zelda endured a lonely, frightening and uncomfortable five day. A man allegedly tied her to the inside of a truck bed and left her in a Texas airport parking garage. When authorities connected him to the dog. he claimed Zelda belonged to his mother, who could no longer care for her and that he had been trying to find the dog a new home. He said he had called "every shelter and no-kill pet center within 200 miles" but that none would accept her.

## Animials suffer when shelters limit who they'll take

There is never any excuse for abandoning an animal. But scenarios like this one are becoming increasingly common as more animal shelters are operating like exclusive clubs or boutiqes instead of refuges. Some shelters have drastically reduced their hours, changed policies to exclude cats, or now require people to make appointments, wait for months or pay a fee to surrender an animals. Some even encourage people to leave homeless animals on the streets.

Taxpayers, who fund public shelters, are increasingly told, "Sorry, we're full," or "We'll have ot pu you on a waiting list," when they try to take stray animals to shelters.


## Why are so many shelters refusing to shelter?

It's undoubtedly connected to growing pressure from a samll, but but extremely vocal, group of people opposed to euthanasia under virtually any circumstances. "Life  at any cost" crusaders harass anvd vilify shelter workers who have the extremely difficult job of euthanizing some animals in order to keep their doors open to all comers.

It may be easier to turn animals away than to endure persecution from armchair activists. But can shelters really be called "shelters" if they close their doors to the animals who need them the most?

## What can be done?

Animals need caring people to speak out against this harmful trend. If you local shelter has started implementing  restrictions or rejecting animals, please get invovled. Write a polite letter expressing your concerns to the shelter's director.

Changed entrenched policies can take time, persistance and patience. But our involvement can determine whether animals in our communiites will ultimately be sheltered or shunned.
