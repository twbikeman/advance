<h1>Acclaim at 'Singer 2020' for Japanese pop diva Misia</h1>

<p>Singer 2020, the eighth season of the hit singing competition, attracted much attention by inviting Japanese pop singer Misia to compete. The other six starting contestants for this season include Taiwan's Jam Hsiao, a co-host of the show, Lala Hsu, and China's Hua Chenyu, Tia Ray, Mao Buyi and Zhou Shen.</p>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the reality TV show premiere had been repeatedly postponed, before finally being broadcast on Feb. 7. In order to avoid home quarantine, all the singers have recorded their weekly performances separately in five different locations---Beijing, Shanghai, Changsha, Taipei and Tokyo---without a live studio audience since Episode 3, while a 500-member audience watches the live stream from home and then casts its votes via an app.</p>

<p>In Episode 3, Misia performed her 2011 classic Ashita E, literally Toward Tomorrow, at Janpanese venue where 10,000 candles were lit up to cheer those fighting the epidemic. The 42-year-old singer was voted No. 1, as her heartfelt performance in Janpanese successfully crossed the language barrier.</p>
