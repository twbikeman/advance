## How to survive a special porject that will double your work time ##

!: I have been asked to take on a speical project that will require me to work roughly double time for the next few weeks. I have accept it willingly and am interested in getting guidance on how to be as effective as possible while managing the strain.

A: Challenges like this can be invigorating, and it sounds like you are approaching it with a positive spirit. That is your best asset going into it, so keep it up!

At the same time, you are wise enough to recognize that there will be effort involved in managing it.

Part of your strategy should be health related. I hear often from people that the first thing to go is health eating. When they are busy, they rely more and more on junk food to get them by.

Next is rest; pretty soon you find yourself getting by on too few hours of sleep.

While you may feel like you are gaining some time, in fact, your actual productivity wil go down. Instead, designate some time to prepare food and adhere to a realistic sleep schedule.

Then look at other ways you can trim your schedule. Keep some social and exercise time, but figure out some sacrifices you can make for the short term. You will be the best judge of the right priorities.

## Stay focused ##
As far as the work itself goes, be sure you are very clear on what needs to be done. Get detailed information on the purpose, outcome, need and risks. This will help you avoid wasted effort.

Map out the tasks needed to accomplish the goal, estimating the time needed to complete each.

Hold to your plan. It is easy to let tasks mushroom, taking eight hours instead two, for example. Knowing what is really required will help you avoid a perfectionism problem.

In the end, the weeks will be done before you know it, and you will have another success behind you.
