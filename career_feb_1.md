# Breaking through the system

## Mat Damon says one simple decsion tranformed his career

Matt Damon wasn't always Matt Damon, Academy Award-winning actor.


For years he was Matt Damon, grinder: acting in student plays at Harvard, winning a small role in School Ties, even leaving college for a role in Geronimo: An American Legend.

As Damon says of that time: "My one skill is that I'll outwork anybody. I'll work harder."

Hard work is often the "secret" to success. The extra mile is largely unpopulated because few people actually get there.

## Hard work alone isn't always enough

Damon and Ben Affleck both auditioned for Dead Poets Society and made enough of an impression to get called back. Each was in the running for a role but ultimately were not hired.

But Damon was at least encouraged by getting a call-back; the business was telling him he was doing "some things right." So he kept grinding, learning , training, auditioning and playing the game---until the casting process for the movie Primal Fear.

Damon did everything he could think of to get the part, including scraping togher money to hire a dialect coach. But Edward Norton won the role (and was later nominated for an Academy Award).

As Damon says: "That was .. one of the things that was really the impetus behind Ben and I writing  Good Will Hunting and focusing on it. We realized the system is not built for you to succeed. You have to break through it.

## Breakthrough

In effect, Damon adn Affleck stopped hoping, dreaming and waiting for one breakthrough role.

They create their own breakthrough roles by writing their own movie (for which they later won an Oscar for Best Screenplay).

No matter what you hoep to achieve, on the surface, it can appear you need to wait to be accepted, to be promoted, to somehow be "discovered."

But that's only true if you allow it to be true.

With a little effort, you can start your own business, create your own products and attract you own funding.

You can do almost anything you want---without waiting for someone to discover you---along as you're willing to work hard and, sometimes, forge your own path.
