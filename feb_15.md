# The role of humility at work

There are many attributes that leaders must develop if they wish to have a meaningful impact in the workplace. Empathy improves your ability to relate with those you lead, while a focus on accountability ensures that everyone gives their best effort.

But among these many important attributes, the value of humility seems to be consistently overlooked. Part of this is due to common misconceptions about what it means to be humble.

Humility tends to be overlooked in the workplace because it is frequently misconstrued as a "weak" attribute. We have been led to believe that people who are humble are easily bulldozed by others and aren't willing to stick up for themselves.

Mnay define humility as having a low opinion of oneself. While this may be one widely accepted view of humility today, it is actually a far cry from the true meaning of the word---and the way it should be applied in leadership. Humility isn't about being passive and weak. It's about showing respect and recognizing truth in all situations, including in the workplace.


## The value of humble outlook at work

A humble professional sounds like the type of person that most of us would prefer to interact with on a daily basis. It is the type of perosn that can become a truly effective leader.

"Humble leaders must be willing to evaluate critism to determine if it's valid or not," said Christopher Ferry, founder of Boca Recovery Center. "The best leader are willing to admit when they are wrong and view mistakes as learning opportunities so they can turn them into something positive---something transformative."

In all my work developing the leadership skills of managers, if I could give them any attribute with magic wand, it would be humility. 

Though humility is often underrated by the world at large, it's essential if you want to be successful as a leaser, not just at work but in life. Reject your notion to boast or lift yourselve above anyone and decide to be at the service of others.
