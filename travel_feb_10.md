## Five tips to help you make your flight

Travel often enough and, eventually, you'll miss a flight. Often that's through no fault of your own; weather, mechanical issues, or maybe the airline just bumps you and makes you take a later flight.

But sometimes you get delayed on the way to the airport.

Or maybe you love to cut it close.

Regardless of the reason why you are in danger of missing your flight, there are things you can do to make sure you get through the check-in and security  processes and to your gate as quickly as possible.


1. Try really hard not to check a bag

Checking a bag slows you down o nhe front and adds a least 14 minutes to the back end of your trip.


But if you do need to check a bag, try to do so at curbside. The lines are almost always shorter.

2. Use a backpack whenever possible

It's a lot easier to hustle through the airport when you aren't dragging a roll-on.

3. Double-check you bgas I've had my backpack searched beacuse I left a half-full soda inside. And I've gotten delayed because of a too-large tube of toothpaste.

Both instances added about 15 minutes to the security process.

A quick scan while waiting in line would have avoided the delay.

4. Get the airline app

If you regularly fly certain airlines, get their apps. Check-in is easy. Plus, you'll get alerts reminding you when it's time to check in. And generally speaking, the apps do a good job of keeping up iwth flight status, gate changes etc.

5. Be nice

If you get to the gate late and the doors are closing and you want any chance of being  allowed to board, ask nicely. While you still might miss your flight, the gate agent is much more likely to work with you---instead of sending you off to a customer service agent---to find another flight.

Besides: Being naice is always the right thing to do.

## tourists beware: Know the rules of Rome

When I traveled to Rome, I enjoyed a few moments of relaxation on the Spanish Steps, which run 138 rungs between the Spanish square and the hilltop Trinià dei Monti church. Tourists have done th esame ince before audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck dallied  on the iconic 18th century stairway in Roman Holiday. My stop there felt nearly obligatory---and entirely pleasant.


But the Roman governmnet is not so pleased.

It recently passed a law that make stting on the Spanish Steps punishable by u to 400 euros. Gone are the selfie-taking, preening teens, the cigarette-smoking loafers. and ehe exhausted tourists just trying to catch their breath even as they relish one of the imperaive sightseeing spots of Rome.


The current look of the Spanish Steps---devoid of loungers---may look odd to anyone who has seen the steps in movies or photos over the years. People have been hanging out there for centuries, afet all. But I appreciate the impulse.

## Preservation attempts

The mayor and City Council are struggling to protect their historical landmarks, as are leaders of many of landmarks, as are leaders of many of Europe's cultural capitals. At least Rome hasn't closed the steps or offered timed entry, as is the case with Barcelona's Park Güell, designed by architect Antoni Gaudi.

The Eternal City is filled with more cultrually significant sights than most.  And it has been attempting to preserve its gems for years. The city made it illegal years ago to roll wheeled bags down the steps of its monuments.

The new law also prohibits wading in the city's fountains.

The law amy aim to discourage bad behavior by tourists, but it's also helping tourists by preserving the very sight they travel to see.
