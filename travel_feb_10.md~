## Five tips to help you make your flight

Travel often enough and, eventually, you'll miss a flight. Often that's through no fault of your own; weather, mechanical issues, or maybe the airline just bumps you and makes you take a later flight.

But sometimes you get delayed on the way to the airport.

Or maybe you love to cut it close.

Regardless of the reason why you are in danger of missing your flight, there are things you can do to make sure you get through the check-in and security  processes and to your gate as quickly as possible.


1. Try really hard not to check a bag

Checking a bag slows you down o nhe front and adds a least 14 minutes to the back end of your trip.


But if you do need to check a bag, try to do so at curbside. The lines are almost always shorter.

2. Use a backpack whenever possible

It's a lot easier to hustle through the airport when you aren't dragging a roll-on.

3. Double-check you bgas I've had my backpack searched beacuse I left a half-full soda inside. And I've gotten delayed because of a too-large tube of toothpaste.

Both instances added about 15 minutes to the security process.

A quick scan while waiting in line would have avoided the delay.

4. Get the airline app

If you regularly fly certain airlines, get their apps. Check-in is easy. Plus, you'll get alerts reminding you when it's time to check in. And generally speaking, the apps do a good job of keeping up iwth flight status, gate changes etc.

5. Be nice

If you get to the gate late and the doors are closing and you want any chance of being  allowed to board, ask nicely. While you still might miss your flight, the gate agent is much more likely to work with you---instead of sending you off to a customer service agent---to find another flight.
