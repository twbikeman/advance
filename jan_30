# The Consequences of Overtourism

## When too much of a good thing quickly becomes a bad thing

The concept of overtourism might seem self-explanatory. At some point in each of our lives, we will most likely find ourselves on a crowded beach or in long lines at popular tourist destination. Frequent travelers are even well-conditioned to look for off-season deals and tips to beat the crowds. Barring that, seasoned travelers know that planning a visit to an extremely popular destination like Venice or Angkor Wat during peak times could mean making reservations at least six months in advance.

## Environmental impact
Overtourism, however, goes beyond crowds and high prices. The sheer mass of outside visitors puts so much pressur on popular sites that they can be in real danger of losing the essence of what makes them so appealing. in some case, the massive influx of tourists over a relatively short period of time completely overwhelms teh ability of local governments to mitigate the impact.

If you look at the trend of growth of international tourism in the last 20 years, the numbers are staggering. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the number of worldwide international tourist arrivals (ITAs) per year has more than doubled over the lst two decades. In 2918 alone, there were 1.4 billion ITAs.

## Easy access

With the proliferation of low-cost carriers, it is now cheaper and easier to get to favorite destinations. Fantastic locations, like the Ta Prohm temple near Angkor, Cambodia, in popular movies such as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider or Thailand's Maya Bay featured in The Beach, are now within reach. And visitors are swarming these sites. So much so, that places like Maya Bay have been forced to face an uncomfortable reality. The only way to sustain the beauty that drasws so many tourists, and tourism dollars, is to close them to all visitors, at least for the time being.

## My journey as a traveler

As a traveler, I have led a very fortunate life. I was an American exchange student in Germany both in high school and during college. I am still addiced to travel. I have set foot on five of the seven continents, and visiting the last two is on my bucket list.

In 2005, I "settled down" by starting a small business with my family in Costa Rica. L lived and worked in a tourist town on the coast of the beautiful and wild Nicoya Peninsula for almost a decade. That's where I met my wife, an American ESL teacher, who is just as passionate about travel and discovery as I am.


## Metting the challenges

Unfortunately, the uncomfortable reality of tourism-based growth in sensitive areas is a story often told in Costa Rica. A beautiful area, rich in natural beauty but undeveloped, gets dicovered by someone traveling off the beaten path. Then, intentionally or not, word gets out, and the stream of visitors goes from a trickle to a flood.

Development starts slowly but eventually outstrips the ability of local governments to sustainably maintain it.Typically, the biggest problems are waste disposal, the depletion of fresh water and the impact on local ecosystems, including keystone species like coral. Fortunately, Costa Rica, as a country, embraced ecotourism long ago. So, ther is history of national agencies working with municipal authoriteis and local businesses to meet the challenges of sustainable growth .

Unexpected growth

Other countries have not fared so well. Many of these regions wre caught off-guard by the explosing of tourists seeking natural wonders portrayed on the big screen, or even on the small screen of social media influencers, leaving countries with few options. Places like Maya Bay or Boracay Island in the Philippines had to completetly close off access to visitors in 2018. While Boracay reopened in Octorber of 2918, Maya BAy will most likely stayclosed until 2021. These are not likely to be isolated incidents. So, for the future, we should all plan to consider how we can travel responsibly and sustainably.
