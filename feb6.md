# Target's newest incubator program focuses on Generation-Z entrepreneurs

One CEO looking for $1.2 million for his startup, Agricycle, which has worked with farmers around the world to make dried fruit out of harvests that would otherwise go waste.

Another has a patent for her company, Terravive, to make compostable cups and forks out of crop scrap. Another is a specialist in prosthetics whose company, Mickey's Mission, makes dolls for children with physical disabilities so they can have toys that resemble them. All three execs are younger than 24.

Last year, these entrepreneurs were among the young founders of eight startups who delivered pitches to an audiene of Target executives. The Minneapolis retailer gave each compnay $10,000 and loaned executives to a seven-week program where the entrepreneurs learned about negotiating, barnding, pitching and more.

Selected from a pool of 400 applicants, they are part of Target's newest accelerator program for early-stage companies. Target incubator is gor Generation-Z entrepreneurs aiming to do good for the world and the planet.

Target now has four accelerator programs that have run 13 boot camps for more than 100 startups since 2013.



AT the pitch day, there were no announcements of any pilot programs or test with Target. But Pak said Target may partner with some of the startups down the road.

"I can assure you ther are several which have piqued people's interests," he said.

## In-flight Wi-Fi may finally be taking off

In May 2004, Lufthansa Airlines became the first commercial airline to offer in-flight Wi-Fi service, with a cost of $30 per full flight or $10 for 30 minutes. The connections were generatlly slow and spotty, and initial use of the service required bi, clunky cords, but there was also an undeniable excitement to browsing the internet and sending emails at 30,000 feet. During the last 15 years, Wi-Fi hsa increasingly become an essential part of our everday lives. It's not surprising, therefore, that Wi-Fi's role in the travel industry has also matured at a rapid pace. In the last few years, for example, Wi-Fi has become both ubiquitous and predominantly free in hotels. While in-flight Wi-Fi isn't yet at the same level---in terms of quality, availability or complimentary access---as hotels, the demand for it certainly is, particularly for the business traveler.

Whiel in-flight Wi-Fi used to be ssen as "nice to have," it has now become absolutely essential, particularly to my clients who are jetting around the world making deals and must be able to use their airtime as efficiently as possible. The inability to access email, networks and people for hours on end can have a huge impact on both individual and group productivity. For many road warriors, that titme in the air may very well be all they have to get essential work completed.

## What travelers are saying

I am not at all surprised by rsults from the most recent in-flight Connectivity Survey, with responses from over 9,300 travelers across 32 countries Six-seven percent of survey respondents said they would be more likely to rebook with airline if in-flight Wi-Fi were available; for business travelers, that number rises to a whopping 83 percent.

## Thre of the main issues surrounding in-flight Wi-Fi

1. Connectivity

There are two ways to connect to Wi-Fi while flying. The first is through air-to-ground broadband towers, which send signals to an airplane's antennas. As the palne travels, it will automatically connect to signals from the nearest tower. Connectivity can be slow and spotty, then, when a plane isn't close to a tower, such as when crossing an ocean.

The newer way to connect is via satelite technology. Planes connect to satelites in orbit through an antenna, and the Wi-Fi signal is then distributed from an onboard router. While the method is generally faster and more consistent, the equipment is expnesive and problems can occur when satellites are overloaded.

2. Wi-Fi usage

In terms of basic internet usage, in-flight Wi-Fi is increasingly being used for very practical reasons for the time-sensitive traveler. The most recent International Air Transporation (IATA) Global Passenger Survey, which involved over 10,400 respondents across 153 countreis, identified 3 emering Trends for Wi-Fi usage preferences: searching connection flight related information, planning the onward journey and filling in customs e-declaration or other e-forms.

3. Cost

Over 80 airlines gobally offer in-flight Wi-Fi, and the cost can vary quite a bit and can change based on things liek route and aircraft model. Fees can be charged by the hour, as a flat rate per flight and even as monthly or yearly subscription. In fact, an airline may offer all of those optoins. It's always a good idea to check out an airline's website for the latest pricing models, including searching for wat is offered on your upcoming flight.
