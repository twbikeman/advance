Cargill puts up $30 million to end forest destruction in Brazil

Cargill Inc., the Minnesota-based agribusiness and key player in Brazilian soy production, said that industry will fail to end deforestation by 2020, and that more companies, governments and organization need to band together to make a more concerted effort if real solutions are to be found.

Soybean farming has continued encroaching on important ecosystems in Brazil, leading to the destruction of critical forests and native vegetations. Demand for the crop is growing as the world's appetite for meat grows. (Soy is often a base ingredient in livestock feed.)

This growing demand encourages many South American farmers to expand their cropland. Cargill is in a powerful position as the world's commodities trader and has taken steps in recent years to slow deforestation in those regions.

But it hasn't been enough.

The company, its peers and international organizations will fall short of reaching their goals said Ruth Kimmelshue, Cargill's head of supply chain and chief sustainability officer.

"I'm not going to admit defeat, but we can all be reasonable people and so that we have significantly more work to do," Kimmelshue said.

In 2014, Cargill signed the United Nations' New York Declaration in Forests, the first global pledge to end and reverse the loss of forests.

Soy production in South America is proving to be more difficult to make environmentally sound than Cargill's other food supply chains.

"We don't believe our industry has the answers to this complex challenge today," Kimmelshue said.

Cargill outlined a six-point action plan for itself related to the destruction of forests in several critical biomes of Brazil and asked its competitors to join in.

The company is looking for a third-party entity to lead what it hopes will be a cross-sector coalition.

"We are prepared to spend the money as soon as possible and as soon as we see ideas that can drive substantive change," Kimmelshue said.

## E-cigarettes may damage brain stem cells

Puffing on electronic cigarettes can damage neural stem cells important to brain function, a new study says.

E-cigarettes produce a stress response in neural stem cells, researchers at the University of California at Riverside reported in a study published in the journal iScience.

E-cigarette users may think they're safer and cleaner than tobacco cigarettes--but evidence is mounting that nicotine is harmful whether it's smoked in a traditional cigarette or vaped in an e-cigarette. Another recennt study found that certain e-cigarette flavorings damage cardiovascular cells.

Such products "are not harmless," said Atena Zahedi, who earned her PhD in bioengineering and coauthored the paper.

"Even short-term exposure can stress cells in a manner that may lead, with chronic use, to cell death or disease. Our observations are likely to pertain to any product containing nicotine," Zahedi said in a statement.

E-cigarettes set off a complex series of cellular-level events that damage stem cells' DNA, the researchers said.

"The neural stem cells get damaged and could eventually die," Zahedi said. "If that happens, no more specialized cells--astrocytes and neurons, for example--can be produced from stem cells."

Those cells are critical, the researchers said. Young people and fetuses are especially prone to stem cell damage because their brains are still developing, the researchers said.

That means young people and pregnant women could be particularly vulnerable to harm from e-cigarettes, the researchers say.

"Nicotine exposure during prenatal or adolescent development can affect the brain in multiple ways that may impair memory, learning and cognition," Prune Talbot, who led the research and directs the Riverside campus's Stem Cell Center, said in the statement.

"Furthermore, addiction and dependence on nicotine in youth are pressing concerns. It's worth stressing that it is nicotine that is doing damage to neural stem cells and their mitochondria."

Given the prevalence and availability of nicotine in liquid, inhalable form, Talbot added, "We should be concerned about this."


## Having a paying job may help fend off Alzheimer's disease in women

A new study has shed light on a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in women: not having job.

Dr. Elizabeth R. Mayeda, assistant professor of epidemiology at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health, conducted a study on later-life cognitive health in women and found that working women showed a slower decrease in memory than their non-working counterparts.

Using data from the National Institute on Aging's Health and Retirement Study, Mayeda examined the memory function patterns of more than 6,000 women born between 1935 and 1956. Women reported each year between the age of 16 and 50 whether they were working for pay or had children and were grouped by their work and family patterns to examine changes in memory for women over age 50.

Memory peformance was measured using standardized tests about every two years, starting when the women were age 50 or older.

According to Mayeda, prior to the age of 60, there were no noticeable differences in memory between working and non-working women. However, after 60, women who participated in the paid labor force showed slower memory decline than those who didn't.

Mayeda's findings showed that the average memory performance for non-working women between the ages for 60 and 70 declined twice as fast as women who were working. Compared with married mothered  in the paid labor force, single mothers out of the workforce for long periods saw their memory faculties decline 83% faster, while married non-working mothers decline 61% faster.Memory performance for working women remained higher, even if their work history was interrupted for family reasons.

"Even though we looked at work and family patterns, what really stood out  in our  findings was that engagement in the paid labor force was the  key factor that stood out as important," Mayeda said.

Mayeda and her fellow researchers are developing a manuscript to submit to peer-reviewed journal.
