## Finding ways to make you European excursion more affordable

While weighing the destination options for traveling n a dime. Scandinvaia, the pricey region in Northern Europe, is an unlikely contender. However, budget airlines continue to lure interational visitors with free stopovers and cheap connecting flights. Once youve landed, though, you'll quickly find some of the steepest prices in the world, thanks to high levels of taxation that help provide a enviable quality of life for its citizens.

So, how do you travel to Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and/or Sweden without blowing a hole in your pocket? Here are some tips for how to experience these beautiful, happy and, yes, expensive countries with as little sticker shock as possible:

## Invest in a good guidebook

Having and using a good guidebook as your main travel tool is essential. The most popular guidebook  series is from Lonely Planet--an especially good choice for young budget travelers since they are the original publishers of Europe on a Shestring. Othe options include Rough Guides,  The Savvy Backpacker and Rick Steves' Europe. These guidebooks will help ypu pick the best activities, including walking tours, parks and restaurants for all budgets. They'll also include maps and heaps of history and local inside knowledge.

## Skip the rental car (and book early)

Once you've found a good deal for you round-trip airfare, it's time to book you regional or in-country transportation. Renting a car is going to cost a pretty penny in any Scandinavian country. Instead, use the region's great public transportation systems, which include a range of affordable options.

AS for trains, we recommend obtaining a Eurail Scandinavia Pass that lets you explore Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The best part for budget travelers: If you take an overnight train, there's no need to pay for a hotel.

The bus is an even more cost-effective mode of transportation, and Scandinavian companies are known to offer clean and comfortable buses that come with bathrooms and free Wi-Fi.

Meanwhile, cyclists will be in heaven: Major cities in Scandinavian offer bike-share programs and rentals pulus bike lanes that are often better tended to than the streets.

## Take advantage of free city culture

While you're spending time in Scaninavia's great cities, ou should enjoy the freebies. Many museums, markets, concerts, outdoor gyms, castles, cathedrals and UNESCO World Heritage sites come without a price tag.

I's also worth checking out the cost-benefit ratio of a city pass, if you're visiting one place for more than a few days. For example, in Norway the Oslo Pass gives you free admission to 30 museums and attractions; free travel on all public transport; free entry to outdoor swimming pools; free walking tours; discounts on sigthseeing, concert tickerts and ski rentals; and special offers in restaurants, shops, entertainment and leisure venues.

## Escape the capital cities for nature

Once you've explored all the great capital cities, the best way to save money is to get out of the cities and head into nature. You don't have ot pay anything to enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Scandinavia's forests, mountains, fjords, glaciers.adventurs, stay in smaller cities and towns that are less accustomed to tourists, espceially away from the cruise ports. Here you'll find that the prices are much more affordable.


## Consider homestays and hostels

One of the best ways to save on accommodations is to opt for homestays (great for families and large groups) or private rooms in international hostels (for singles or couples).


But, if you love to staying at hotels, Scandinavian properties tend to put out impressive displays for breakfast (often included in the rate), so it may be worth the cost if you plan on having a big meal to start your day. Another plus: Some hotels in the mountains will let guests pack a lunch from the breakfast buffet.

## Take a Scandinavian cruise

Booking an all-inclusive cruise through Scandinavia can be a great way to experience several port cities and the scenery without having ot pay for hotels and meals. There are plenty of luxury cruises that make their way through the Scandinavian countries, but picking a budget option can be smart , espcially for families.
