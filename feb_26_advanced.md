## Coud we harness the light form bioluminescent organisms?

Bioluminescence---defined by Merriam-Webster as "the emission of light form living organisms (such as fireflies, denoflagellates and bacteria) as the result of internal, typically oxidative, chemical reactions"---is one of the wonders of nature that just about any of us can witness.

While a few organisms can produce bioluminescent light outside of the oceans (thin fireflies), most of the bioluminescence going on is in salt water. In fact, teh vast magority of bioluminiscent organisms evolved in order to provide light in deep sea marine ecosystems---either to light up prey or as a warning against predators---far below sunlight's reach into the water column. 

Humans have been putting natural bioluminescence to work for a while---19th century coal miners would trap fireflies in jars and use them as safety lights (instead of open-flame candles or lanterns that could cause an explosion). But nowadays researchers are hard at work synthesizing the chemical reactions behind bioluminescence for a range of modern-day applications.

### Practical applications

Harnessing bioluminescence to help cure disease is a big focus of some biomedical research companies, given the promise of using heat-free organic light to detect metastasizing cancer cells, stem cells, viruses or bacteria within living tissue. The military also has big hopes for utilizing the chemical reactions of bioluminescence to create light that won't tirgger the heat-seeking sensory equipment of the enemy whether on land, at sea or in the sky.

Some other practical applicaions of bioluminescence, as recently hightlighted by Popular Mechanics, include an effort to splice genes from bioluminescent organisms into trees that would light up when the sun sets (as an all-nautral alternative to street lights), using bioluminiscent bacterium to highlight contaminants in drinking waer supplies and genetically modifying crop seeds to grow fruits and vegetables that could signal thier need for more water or other input by glowing according.

While noen of these "technologies" is yet ready for mainstream implementations, it's good to know that the future looks bright.
