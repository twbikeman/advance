## Rinse, read, repeat: Laundromats are becoming libraries

In The Wash House Laundromat in Durham, North Carolina, a child sits n a gray carpet, holding clean socks in one hand and a brand new book in the other.

He got it through a program that is turning laundromats into learning spaces where families can read books, play games and use learning materials while they wait for their wash.

The Wash & Learning program is a partnership among Book Harvest, The Wash House laundromats and Libraries Without Borders, an international literacy organization.

Rachel Stine, the program director for Book Harvest, visited one of the laundromats to volunteer with the program, which the program, which offers story times twice a week and leaves free books out for people to take.


But instead of reading to the 3-year-old there that day, Stine sat and watched the boy sitting on his mother's lap at the child-sized table, reading a book about animals.

"Roar!" he giggled.

"Hiss," he whispered.

"That's right," his mother said as she flipped the page.

Wash & learn helps prepare children to reach third-grade reading proficiency and succeed beyond that, Stine said.

"All of this happened right before my eyes," she said. "It was because these tools were available to him. He was naturally engaged. I showed up, and even if I didn't read to him, he was already reading with his mom. He was learning."

This was when Stine realized the potential of the program.

## Meeting families 'where they are'

"I would love to see this program replicated throughout ... different parts of the state," owner Lee Williford said.

Book Harvest, which runs Wash & Learn in Durham, has over 30 free book shelves placed around the city.

"We want to make sure families have access to books and those books are everywhere in our community," Stine said. "Rather than having families look for those resources, we are meeting them where they are."

## Adopting a cat? Here's what to consider

Before adopting, there are a few factors to consider, such as if a cat fits into your lifestyle, whether to get a kitten or an older cat and how to welcome your new feline to the family.

## Consider the commitment--and the costs

When deciding whether to adopt a cat, determine if you're ready to take on a long-term commitment.

"A cat can mean 20 years of daily care," said Melissa Levy, Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) executive director.

While lower-maintenance than most dogs, cats do require socialization, said Morris Animal Refuge director of operations, Carolyn Fitzgerald. "Daily petting and playtime is crucial to fostering a happy cat that will engage with your family."

At least 15 minutes of interaction per day is recommended for any cat.


## Pick for personality (and age)

"Cats are like humans--there are all sorts of personality types," said Karen O'Rourke, the president of Stray Cat Relief Fund and owner of six cats.


If you prefer owning one cat, Levy advises opting for an adult, since kittens need to socialize.

## Prepare your home

Before bringing a new cat home, do a quick scan of your furniture. Are your bookcases secure? Put away fragile items, as well as plastic bags.

Household plants can pose danger, too; some common varieties are toxic to cats.

## Make introductions

When a cat shows signs of comfort, like perked ears and prance in its step, it's ready to nose its way through other parts of the house. If you have a dog, keep it leashed while introducing the cat--and don't give up hope if it's not love at first sight. Multiple introductions may be necessary.

Kids should also be introduced with care.

"Children need to be counseled on how to pet so that the cat doesn't end up getting manhandled," Fitzgerald said.

## Adapting
> Once your house is in gear, identify a room to serve as the cat's home for the first week after adoption.
"Change can cause cats to easily become stressed out. They should have a small  quiet space--even if it's just a bathroom--where they can slowly adapt," Levy said.

## Four home filters you should never ignore

You can't see most of the filters in your home, but they're there, keeping toxins and other bad stuff from the air that you breathe and the water that you drink. Besides their obvious health benefits, filters keep your home's systems and appliances shipshape. That is, unless they become seriously clogged or damaged, in which case they can do more harm than good.

So, which filters are the most critical to maintain?  Here are the four essentials, according to the pros at HomeAdvisor:

1. Clothes dryers

You're probably good about cleaning your dryer's lint screen build-up in and around the dryer duct and vent filter filter. Of the 2,900 home dryer fires reported each year, failure to clean the unit is the leading cause, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.

Pro tip: If your clothes are suddenly taking longer to dry than normal, there's a good chance you have a clogged filter.

2. Drinking water

Water filters remove harmful contaminants, but if you leave the filter too long it will clog up, potentially resulting in higher levels of contamination. Carafe-style  filters usually need to be changed monthly, while large countertop or under -sink systems might only require an annual changing.

3. Vacuum cleaners

If your vacuum's filter gets dirty enough, it will eventually start to lose suction, but even before it reaches that point, it might start to spew dust and other tiny particulates back into the air. That can seriously affect the indoor quality in your home, especially fore allergy sufferers.

Pro tip: When shopping for a new vacuum, look for a model with a washable filter.

4. Air purifiers and dehumidifiers

These devices have filters that can be cleaned quickly and easily to maintain performance and minimize the risk of equipment failure. Since dehumidifiers often sit in dank areas, always check the filter for signs of mold, mildew and dust mites. If any are present, it's time for a new filter.
