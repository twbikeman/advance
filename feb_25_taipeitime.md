# Marbles' return 'not linked to Brexit talks'

Greece distanced itself on Wednes from suggestions that it planned to drag a centuries-old dispute over the return of the Parthenon marbles into Brexit negotiations.

Government spokeman Stelios Petsas said Athens would keep up its campaign for the return of the 2,500-year-old treasures and will consider which tools could support its cause.

"Greece's request for the return of the Parthenon marbles remains strong and its is not linked to a Brexit deal," Petsas said, asked if the issue could be stumbling point in talks with Britain on its future relationship with the European Union.

"We'll continue to call for thier return  and if this is a tool we can use, we'll consider it in due course," he said.

Since independence in 1832, Greece has repeatedly called for the return of the sculptures---known in Britain as the Elgin marbles---that British diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th century, when Greece was under Ottoman rule.

The British Museum in London has refused to return the sculptures---roughly half of a 160m frieze which was seen by Reuters on Feb. 18, seeks the "return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural obejcts to thier countries of origin."

The document did not specify any cultural objects, but an EU diplomat said the term was added at the request of Greece, with support from Italy.

Last month, Greece's Culture Minister Lina Mendoni called Elgin a "serial thief" who employed illegal tactics to take the marbles. She said she believes the circumstances are ripe for the marbles' return.
