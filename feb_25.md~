One afternoon ...

What I like about Exodus---besides alluring itineraries and prices---is the company 's charitable involvement  with visit3ed communities.

Miles after our excellent driver, Youssef, deftly handles clifftop haripin turns, we arrive at a dirt path for a 90-minute walk---mules take our luggage---to the remote rural village of Tighza ,200 feet up in the snowcapped High Atlas Mountains. This is where Exodus in 2012 funded and built a customary hammam, which is a public bath that is an important place for local women to socialize. Tighza's hammam also generates income for villagers since Exodus pays for its own clients.


Never a dull moment
Throughout our adventure, hours on the road are never dull. We stop to amble through dramatic Roman ruins of one-time capital Volubilis, peer at bizarre climbing goats who perch on high branches or argan trees to eat fruit, and wander through a Berber open-air market. In the verdant Valley of the Roses, we buy floral toiletries at a vegetable tagine delivered in a nifty simmering cone-shaped pot. Then, we bunk two nights in Essaouira, a historic port town and wind-surfing hotspot on the Atlantic Ocean. The UNESCO-listed medina charms with its whitewashed buildings, royal-blue shutters and European touch.
