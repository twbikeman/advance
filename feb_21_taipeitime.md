Live Nation's TicketMaster expands into Asia by acquiring Tixcraft

Ticketmaster, a US ticket sales system under Live Nation Entertainment, announced plans last week to expand into Asia by acquiring Taiwan's Tixcraft Inc. and launching Ticketmaster Singapore, increasing its presence to 32 countries around the world.
Ticketmaster is a global ticketing giant with over 500 million tickets processed yearly.

"By bringing Ticketmaster's technology and service to Taiwan and tapping into the company's huge global network, we will revolutionize the ticketing experience for fans, venues, sports clubs adn event organizers in Taiwan," said KT Chiu, chief executive officer of Tixcraft who founded the Taiwanese ticketing platform in 2014.

However, some Taiwanese users are concerned about certain features of Ticketmaster, including the "resale" function that allows buyers to sell tickets at higher prices---such tickets are seen as "scalper tickets" in Taiwan. In order to assuage concerns, Live Nation Entertainment has said that functions inappropriate for Taiwan may be removed from the Taiwanese system.
