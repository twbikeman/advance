# Taipei Zoo giant panda undergoes annual artificial insemination procedure

With the arrival of sprint weather and flowers in ful blossom, Taipei Zoo'femail giant panda, Yuan Yuan, is in estrus (on heat). Zoo keepers began to detect a series of signs starting from Feb. 9when they noticed Yuan Yuan was rubbing her vulva, which they observed was swollen and secreting fluid. Zoo keepers also noticed other tell-tale signs, including pacing around her enclosure, running about and bathing in the water pools. As the indications became increasingly apparent, zoo keepers' statistical modeling, using a range of indices including an analysis of hormone levels, determined that Yuan Yuan would be in "peak estrus" on Thursday last week. Zoo veterinarians carried out two rounds of artificial insemination last Wednesday afternoon adn Thursday morning to take advantage of the small window of opportunity in which pandas are able to conceive.

Breeding specialists from the Bifengxia Giant Panda Base research and breeding center in China's Sichuan Province would usually visit the zoo every year during Yuan Yuan's estrus period. However, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, no speciallists from the center werer able to travel to Taiwan this year. As a workaround, once Yuan Yuan was confirmed to be in estrus, veterinarians held a video conference to discuss her condition with the center's Wang Chengdong.

According to the zoo, this year's artificial insemination operation was carried out by a team of zoo veterinarians under the guidance  of medical experts from the Wild Animal Healthcare and Treatment Group, including professor Lie Chin-hsuan, veterinarian Chang Chih-hua, doctors Sun Wei-zen and Wang Yi-chia form nation Taiwan Univeristy's Department of Anaesthesiology and Wei Ling-ying from the hospital's Department of Dentistry. In addition to carrying out artificial insemination, the team performed an annual health check up on Yuan Yuan and her mate, Tuan Tuan, which including carrying out ultrasound tests on their teeth and abdomens to gain a complete picuter of the pandas' overal health.
