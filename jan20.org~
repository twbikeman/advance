* Tree Simple Words

** Words that could save your marriage, your career and even your life

*** My family just got back from a wonderful vacation. It was 10 days of good food, great sun and beautiful beaches. One day had the potential to ruin our trip, though. I had caught a bad cold, and was contemplating staying home. But my wife had her heart set on the beach, and since we have three small children, I came along to help out.

** Going along with the plan

*** I thought we might head to the same beach we went to just a few days earlier. But my wife wanted to try a different beach, so I went along with the plan. We arrive, and my wife was in heaven.

*** I wasn't as enthusiastic. The sand wasn't nearly as soft as I like. And the surf was much rougher, which certainly didn't please my 4-year old. As I kept comparing this beach to the other one. my mood deteriorated. And then I remebered three little words that have saved my relationship time and time again: Disagree and commit.
