Gloria ...in Excelsis Deo. (Gloria!)


Joy to the world! The Lord is come!

Let earth receive her King.

Let every heart prepare Him room

And heav'n and nature sing

And heav'n and nature sing

And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing.

Joy to the world! The Savior reigns!

Let men their songs employ.

While fields and floods,

Rocks, hills and plains,

Rpeat the sounding joy,

Repaet, repaet the sounding joy. (Gloria!)

He rules  the world with turth and grace

And amkes the nations prove

The glories of His righteousness

And wonders of His love

And wonders of His love

And wonders of His love

(Sing Gloria! Sing Gloria)

'The First Noel'

The first Noel, the angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds  in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!
Born is the King og Israel!

What child is this?

Waht child is this, who , laid to rest!

On Mary's lap is sleeping,

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,

While Shepherds wach are keeping!

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

This, this is Christ the King,

The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incese, gold and myrrh

Come peasant, King to own Him.

The King of kings salvation brings.

Let loving hearts enthrone him.

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.

This, this is Christ the King,

The Babe, the Son of Mary.

The Babe, the son of Mary.

## Why giving gifts--not receiving them--is what creates real holiday happines


The holidays are here.

And while many people are focused on the gifts they hope to receive, the indivisuals spending more time and energy giving their presence and presents to others ar going to be happier--I guarantee it.

When yo spend excessive time thinking ab out what you want ot receive, it createds selfishness. Immaturity. And expectations that are setting yourself up for disappointment.


Approaching the holidays while maintaining this self-focus is missing the point entirely.

The more that you focus on giving, the more lightness illuminates your being. Awakens your heart. And integrates you further into the bliss of authenticity.

## Showing you care

Giving gifts, at a fundamental level, is an exchange of energy. It's symbolically communicating to another person that you care. That--even though you don't always say it--you value the essence of someone else.

Despite all of your shortcomings and limitations, this holiday time period provides you with the opportunity to make things right. To clearly communicate your gratitude towards the people you love.


In the moment of pure giving--without focusing on yourself or your reactions or your gifts or your money or how you feel if someone doesn't like your gift--you are actively creating the positive change we all wish to see in the world. You are creating a selfless environment built on the foundation of mutual cooperation.

It is my hope that you step outside of your comfort zone--the typical patterns of greed and self-interest--and step into a new way of being that crates the figts that keep on giving: real happiness, love, gratitude and appreciation.

Please enjoy your holidays and remember that giving, not receiving, will bring your real happiness.
