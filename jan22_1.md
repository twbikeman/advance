## Identify your priorities

"It's important to identify your priorities," said Liz, aka Mrs. Frugalwoods, who runs the personal finance website Frugalwoos.com Perhaps you want to take a vacation every year, retire early or stay at home with your children. Once you know what you goals are, you can comb through your expenses to see whether your money is going toward things you value or things that aren't as important . Liz and her husband made it a goal to leave their office jobs in the city and work from home on a 66-acre homestead in Vermont. They were willing to pay a lot for a nice house because they spned most of the time at home. But they drive an older car, Liz's husband cuts her ahir, and she hasn't bought new clothes in two years---because those things aren't as important to the pair.

## Find ways to trim recurring expenses

Liz noted that you also need to look at recurring expenses---such as mortgage or rent payments, utilities and gas for your ca---to identify the costs that are fixed and not fixed.

"Groceries are not fixed," she said. To save money on food, Liz and her husband buy raw ingredient in bulk---rather than items that are packaged and pre-made---and make most everything they eat.

In addition to cutting food costs, yu might be able to lower your monthly bills by switching service providers, negotiating lower rates or even eliminating sercies you don't need.

## Do what you love for less

Holly Johnson, founder of the blog Club Thrifty.com, said that when she and her husband created a polan to cut expenses so they could pay off debt, they agreed that travel was one category of spending they didn't want to eliminate.

"As a result, we cut back futher elsewhere so we could continue traveling a few times per year," she said.
