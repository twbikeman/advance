# Why East Kalimantan?

Kalimantan is the name of Indonesia's portion of Borneo, an island shared with Malaysia and Brunei that's located near the center of Indonesia. East Kalimantan, 1,300 miles removed from Jakarta, is the most developed of Kalimantan's five provinces. It features two of the region's largest cities in Balikpapan and Samarinda and boasts modern infrastructure such as a pair of international airports, toll roads and seaports. Another decisive advantage of East Kalimantan is its relative safety from natural disasters because it is buffered by the islands of Java to the south and Sulawesi to the east and rarely experiences earthquakes of any significance, particularly by Indonesian standards.

## When will the new capital be up and running?

The new capital still needs approval from parliament. The relocation and building of the city could cost at least $33 billion and spark a clamor for state contracts. The plan is for construction to begin in 2021 and governmnet employees to start moving into their new offices by 2024---though experts are skeptical a project of this magnitude will finish on time. The new city would start on about 700 square miles of government-owned land near Balikpapan and Samarinda.

## Don't count Jakarta out

The megacity will remain Indonesia's financial center---meaning local politics will continue to serve as a national springboard for foreseeable future.

"IT's too early to predict how the proposed new capital will shift the domestic political dynamic political dynamics because we don't know how long it will take to completethis highly ambitious porject," said Bend Bland, director of the Southeast Asia project at Sydney, Australia-based think tank Lowy Institute. "But the governorship of Jakarta is likely to remain an important political stage because the city will still be Indonesia's business capital and, for and away, largest city."
