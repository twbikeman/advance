Gloria ...in Excelsis Deo. (Gloria!)


Joy to the world! The Lord is come!

Let earth receive her King.

Let every heart prepare Him room

And heav'n and nature sing

And heav'n and nature sing

And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing.

Joy to the world! The Savior reigns!

Let men their songs employ.

While fields and floods,

Rocks, hills and plains,

Rpeat the sounding joy,

Repaet, repaet the sounding joy. (Gloria!)

He rules  the world with turth and grace

And amkes the nations prove

The glories of His righteousness

And wonders of His love

And wonders of His love

And wonders of His love

(Sing Gloria! Sing Gloria)

'The First Noel'

The first Noel, the angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds  in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!
Born is the King og Israel!

What child is this?

Waht child is this, who , laid to rest!

On Mary's lap is sleeping,

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,

While Shepherds wach are keeping!

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

This, this is Christ the King,

The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incese, gold and myrrh

Come peasant, King to own Him.

The King of kings salvation brings.

Let loving hearts enthrone him.

This, this is Christ the King,

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.

This, this is Christ the King,

The Babe, the Son of Mary.

The Babe, the son of Mary.
