## Results of the survey

To better understand diabetes distress on unviersity campuses, Ohio university researchers conducted an online survey in December 2017 and January 2018.

Of the 173 people who completed the survey, 56 were students and 117 were empoloyees. About half of the participants had Type 1 diabetes; the remainder had Type2.

The findings support earlier research taht diabetes stress is a significant issue and point to the need for more research among a broader student and faculty population, Beverly said.  

About 27 perent of respondents with Type 1 diabetes and 30 percent of respondents with Type2 reported high diabetes distress.  

Students reported higher rates of diabetes distress than faculty and staff, Beverly said.  

Feelings of powerlessness, stress about eating properly and adequately manaing diabetes wre the most common concerns participants reported.  

Many survey respondents showed signs of severe depression.

## Making adjustments

Food is something Reilly thinks about a lot and is an aspect of college he anticipates he'll need to approach with extra care. "Foods that wouldn't be an issue for just any one are an issue for me," Reilly said.  

Pizza, for exmaple, is loaded with fat and carbs. Reilly must plan carefully to ajusts his insulin pump to accommodate the effect a slice would have on his blood sugar levels.

As he starts out in a new school, Reilly wants to make sure the new friends and classmates he meets don't misunderstand what it means to have diabetes. Sure, he can't eat whatever he wants whenever he wants, but is stll in control of his life.  

"It is kind of a pain to deal with, but a lot of people that I come across are like, 'Oh, you can't do this, you can't do that.' And that's not the case," Reilly said. "I can do pretty much everything someone without diabetes can do; I just have to be careful."
