# Indonesia's Quest for a New Capital

Why is Indonesia changing things up?

Indonesia was in search of a new city to replace overcrowded and smoggy capital.

The site had to be centrally located and offer ample land to build a city from scratch.

The Southeast Asian nation---sprawled along the Pacific "Ring of Fire"---also needed a place safe from earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis---a uniquely Indonesian problem that eliminated most parts of the country from contention.

One place, however, met those prerequisites. After months of speculation, Indonesian President Joko Widodo revealed that East Kalimantan, a resource-rich province of tropiocal forest, was selected to replace the current capital of Jakarta.

If parliament approves, the world's fourth most populous country could join a small club of nations since the 1900s to relocate their capital, a club that includes India, Australia and Myanmar.

The announcement brings Indonesia closer than ever to realizing a relocation plan that had been considered for decades.

## Challenges in Jakarta

Jakarta is now home to 10 million residents---30 million, including the suburbs. It's a heaving environmental mess with some of the worst air pollution and traffic congestion in the world. Parts of the metropolis are sinking more than seven inches each year because of the depletion of underground water wells. The city is largely located below sea level, and the government is racing to build walls to hold back the ocean. Flooding is common during the rainny months, adding to the misery of an overcrowded city on pace to become the world's largest by 2030.

## Development and political power are vastly uneven

Indonesia is a sprawling nation whose 270 million inhabitants are spread across three time zones along the equator or more than 17,000 islands, including tourist hot spots such as Bali. The country's eastern and western ends are seperated by more than 3,500 miles, leaving many parts of Indonesia neglected, highlighted by the fact that more than 80 percent of the country's economic output comes from the main western islands of Java, where Jakarta is located, and Sumatra. Shifting the capital to a more central location is aimed at alleviating a bit of that disparity.
