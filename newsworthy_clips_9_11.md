Chimp champ Jane Goodall enlists advanced mapping technology for nature and humanity

In ground-breaking research beginning nearly 60 years ago, Jane Goodall has devoted her to understanding chimpanzees.

Goodall, 85, lived among chimps in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, gathering observations that reached the public in a series of popular books. She depicted how chimps live in societies, in peace, conflict and even war.


Now the English primatologist has enlisted a provider of 21st-century mapping science to understand and protest nature and help their human neighbors thrive alongside wildlife without conflict.

Geographic Information System CGIS) provider Esri will provide the Jane Goodall Institute GIS-software tools to document natural and human resources, including wildlife reserves, towns and flood-control areas. The institute, fellow scientists and local volunteers will collect the information and, with Esri's help, use that knowledge to refine their conservation efforts.

Esri's software puts data into visual formats that people can more easily interpret. Patterns that might not be obvious from a list of numbers leap out form a map. City, stat and federal governments, companies and nonprofits buy Esri's software for that purpose.

Goodall said a major goal of the institute is to prevent or end conflict between wildlife and the welfare of people living nearby.

For the safety of chimpanzees such as those she studies in Tanzania, willing cooperation with villages is essential, and Esri is already helping, Goodall said.

"we began with 12 villages and we're now up to 104," Goodall said. "Most of the chimpanzees in Tanzania are not protected. They're not in any of the parks or reserves. They're just in villages or forest reserves where they are not protected at all."

Volunteers in those villages are working with the institute because they understand that protecting the environment helps people, too, Goodall said.

Goodall and Esri President Jack Dangermond urged the public to get involved in conservation, at whatever level they can.

"I don't care whether it's gardening or working in a factory," Dangermond said. "Everyone can do something."




## Junk food places lure you in with scent

Junk food vendors are well aware that the scent of their product triggers a craving in your brain. It is a response that has been researched, and you better believe your favorite fast-food chains have marketing teams that are using that research to thier advantage.

Let's take a closer look at this process. Have you ever noticed whatever indulgent treat catches your nose's atttention tends to be most appealing just after you first smell it? A couple minutes later you're standing in line, and it isn't quite as irresistible as it was just moments ago, but now you're invested, and you trust that first instinct to gorge yourself.

But recent science says that this is actually the right moment to walk away.

"Ambient scent can be powerful tool to resist cravings indulgent foods," said Dipayan Biswas, a marketing professor at the University of South Florida Colleg of Business.

Biswas led research that found there is a direct connection between how long a person is exposed to indulgent food scents and choosing healthier foods.

"The results of a series of experiments, including field studies at a supermarket and at a middle school cafeteria, show that extended sxposure (of more than two minutes) to an indulgent food-related ambient scent (e.g., cookie scent) leads to lower purchases of unhealthy foods compared with no ambient scent or a nonindulgent food-related ambient scent (e.g., strawberry scent)," reads the study summary.

What appears to be going on here is that the brain doesn't necessarily distinguish betwee a pleasurable smell or taste.

"Prolonged exposure to an indulgent/rewarding food scent induces pleasure in the reward circuitry, which in turn diminishes  the desire for actual consumption of indulgent foods," the paper explains.

So next time you're feeling you don't have the willpower to resist that gigantic cinnamon roll, it might be as simple as sitting there and smelling all the sweetness for just a minute or two.

## Coffee and chocolate make you smarter, according to latest neuroscience


Neuroscience continues to uncover new ways that coffee and (to a lesser extent) tea and chocolate, tend to make brains healthier and more resilient.

First, a joint study from the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University, published in Neurochemical Research magazine, discovered that methylxanthines--a class of chemical found in coffee, tea and dark chocolate (cacao) --"have clear effects on neuronal network activity, promote sustained cognitive performance and can protect neurons against dysfunction and death in animal models of storke, Alzheimer's disease and Pakinson's disease."

That same study also discovered that xanthine metabolites--a chemical released when your brain process caffeine--"may also contribute to the beneficial effects of coffee, tea and cacao on brain health."

Second, a meta-analysis of 11 studies on the impact of coffee on brain health and published in World Journal of Surgical Oncology showed that bothe coffee and tea (and thus, by extention, cacao) don't just reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease but also reduce the risk of brain cancer.

Finally, a ground-breaking study at Okayama University indicated that caffeine makes your brain more flexibile and resilient.

The big takeawya: if you want to keep you brain healthy both today and in the future as you age, you should be consuming coffee, tea or caocao.

It need hardly be said that, for other health reasons, you should be consuming coffee, tea and cacao without suger or creamer. But you still get the brain-boost, regardless.
