# Looking Ahead to the New Year

You might think that working on two projects at the same time will make you feel like you're accomplishing more. But in many cases, it's just not true. Time-blocking may help you counteract the impulse to multitask.


Follow these steps and get ready to work smarter and more effectively--not harder and fumbling towards burnout.

Step 1: Decide when to schedule what

The first task is to observe yourself. Take a few days to pay attention to what times and days are your most productive. This will help determine when you should schedule your harder and more creatively-intensive work and at what times you should work on tasks that require less focus.

Write down your tasks and how you felt energy- and motivation-wise while performing them. Write down when you find yourself giving in to multitasking.

In my case, I noted that I typically feel strongest and most creative in the morning hours. This resulted in me trying to complete projects while answering emails or interacting on social media throughout. But, this slowed all of those  tasks down and made me less effective on each.
