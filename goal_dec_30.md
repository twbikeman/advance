# Looking Ahead to the New Year

You might think that working on two projects at the same time will make you feel like you're accomplishing more. But in many cases, it's just not true. Time-blocking may help you counteract the impulse to multitask.


Follow these steps and get ready to work smarter and more effectively--not harder and fumbling towards burnout.

Step 1: Decide when to schedule what

The first task is to observe yourself. Take a few days to pay attention to what times and days are your most productive. This will help determine when you should schedule your harder and more creatively-intensive work and at what times you should work on tasks that require less focus.

Write down your tasks and how you felt energy- and motivation-wise while performing them. Write down when you find yourself giving in to multitasking.

In my case, I noted that I typically feel strongest and most creative in the morning hours. This resulted in me trying to complete projects while answering emails or interacting on social media throughout. But, this slowed all of those  tasks down and made me less effective on each.

Step 2: Organize your tasks

Prioritize tasks by both importance and urgency in that order.

In my case, completing writing work in the morning had the most importance for me. I decided to block out one to two hours for this work (with small Pomodoro breaks along the way). After that, I knew I would be ready for more mechanical, rote work  such as answering emails.

Organizing your tasks like this will help you to stop doing "busy work" and instead advance your most important work and your longer term goals.

Step 3: optimize your agenda

Based on your optimal times, designate days and times for usual tasks according to importance, difficulty and urgency. Assign time blocks according to your best estimated and adjust accordiingly, until you feel it's an optimal reflection of your priorities, energy levels and personal needs.

Finally, if you think you  can accomplish a task in an hour, don't assign it more time, or you'll end up wasting time.

## resolutions:  Time for an update?

If you're like most people, your New Year's resolutions for everything from losing weight and quitting smoking to saving more and spending less aren't as compelling a few  weeks into the new year. For many of us, these nebulous goals are abandoned within the first two weeks of January.

## Try something different

Why not consider revising your goals to include something just as healthy and positive, but with a more far-reaching impact, such as committing to donate your time and money throughout the year?

According to United Health Group, when you give of yourself, you get an increased sense of purpose and decreased stress levels. In Layman's terms: Giving feels good. And feeling better can foster a whole set of positive habits, including taking care of your physical and financial health.

## Where to start

A great way to get started is by visiting UniversalGiving's website, which offers opportunities to give back globally. For as little as $10, you can buy mosquito nets to protect children from contracting malaria or food and books for amilies in need. Or, if you have time to volunteer, you can choose from opportunities n more than 100 countries, including tutoring children in Ethiopia or working with locals in Thailand to preserve that country's elephant habitat.


UniversalGiving thoroughly vets every partner organization. This makes sure that your funds will go the to right place and make the biggest difference..

## Real change

"Real change happens through one-on-one connection. If one person can connect with another and increase their compassion and rspect for others, then we are on our way to world that recognized, and lives, peace," said UniveralGiving Found and CEO Pamela Hawley.

Now this is a resolution we can all feel good about.
