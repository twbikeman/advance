# How to have an amazing marriage and winning business

Entrepreneurs sacrifice a lot to get their businesses off the ground. There are countless stories of founders sleeping in cars or eating ramen to save money. But there are some things entrepreneurs can't sacrifice. The two most important are also those that easily fall the wayside with the hustle and bustle of building a business: our kids and our marriage.

## Trying to repair the damage

For all intents and purposes, I abandoned my marriage to build a business. I know, bad move. Diruing this time, I kept telling myself that everything was doing was for my family. Yes, it was a lie, but I believe it.

For the past year and a half, I have been working to repair the damage I did. I cut my travel down to almost nothing. I sent others in my place or just said "no" nuless it was imperative I go. I piroritized my marriage as my number one.

And here is what I learned:

1. You can't undo the damage done to your family, You can only pray they give you the grace to start over.

2. Relationships are gragile. It takes no effort to damage them, but it takes immese effort  to repair damage that's already been done.

3. Nothing replaces quality time. 

4. No business need is greater than the daily need of an active and present father/mother in the home.

5. I make better business decisions when I'm prioritizing my family.

## A positive impact on business

Prioritizing time for my marriage required me to shift my attention, allowing my mind a chance to slow down and reset. When I returned to work, the rest, relaxation and improvements and improvements in my personal life had an immediate impact.

Take a deep breath and stop listening to all the voices that tell you to sacrifice your life for monetary success. Instead, do as Mother Teresa suggested and "go home and love your family." You will feel refreshed, renewed and make better decisions when you get back to the office.
