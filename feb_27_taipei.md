# The origins of 'corona'

The name "coronavirus" is descriptive of the virus paricles (virions), which look like the tines of a crown. In ancient Rome, the Latin corona meant a crown or garland bestowed for distinguihshed military service. By extension, it has come to be used as byword for the royal family.

In old English law, the title custos placitorum coronae meant "keeper of the pleas of the crown." The title was then simplified to coroner, and later, by the 17th century, the coroner's duties were reduced to examining the reasosns for a person's death.

"Coronation" also derives from the Latin root, and from around 1400 has meant the "act or ceremony of investing (a sovereign) with a crown."

The shape of the crown has led to the use of "corona"
