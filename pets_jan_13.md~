## A look at one special shelter dog and animal shelter problems

## A hyper shelter dog and a boy with epilepsy

An epilepsy diagnosis at age 9 changed Parker Rogers' life drastically. The Fresno boy was having seizures almost daily. He nolonger could attend public school, and his time with friends was limited. Then, Parker met "Toby the Great."

THe yellow Labrador didn't took promising at first. Lbrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno had scoop him up form a local shelter. Parker's mother, Mandy Rogers, recalls a thin, hyper, dirty dog. She was convinced this was not to be their dog. But of all the dogs available that day, Parker wanted Toby. And so the Lab joined the Rogers family.

Shortly after aking him home, Toby taught himself how to detect his boy's seizures befor they happened.

It startled Mandy Rogers the first time Toby tried to help. He was jumping on Parker, nipping at his mother's hands and trying to herd the family into one room.

Mandy called a dog trainer for advice, worried about this strange, erratic behavior. Then Parker had a seizure. It turned out Toby was trying get Parker to sit down because he could sense a seizure coming and was trying to alert Mandy.

Since then, Toby has learned how to fetch emergency seizure medication for Paker. He'll also run to get Parker's mom when a seizure is coming on. If Parker is sitting down when a seizure is about to happen, Toby sits on the boy and doesn't let him stand up.

Parker says Toby helps him feel safe and secure. Along with being a friend, the dog has given him the confidence to be more independent.


"I could finally sleep in my room alone, just me and Toby," Parker said. "I can go out and ride my bike, just me and Toby. Toby's life changed, too. He went form being a stray dog, to a rescue, to the most important part of my medical team."
"Our family rescued Toby," Parker says, "but he really rescued me."

## Opinion: Animal shelters, a refuge for strays or a pet boutique?
