# UP FROM THE ASHES
## In a tiny California town ravaged by fire, a muralist finds a calling

Nicole Wedding felt a strange sense of calm as she stood in the driveway, her gaze fixed on the wall, she did not expect to ever again find peace in this town, where all that was left of her home was ash, rubble and rusted metal. Yet it was comforting to see her daughter's portrait rendered delicately on the wall.

Her daughter Eleanor had refused to set foot in Paradise, California, in the weeks after the fire. So Nicole had visited just twice: first to see if any belongings survived the flames, and later to see the mural. Nicole had offered the wall to an old friend from Chico High school, a commercial artist named Shane Grammer.

## Inspiration in the midst of disaster

Shane has always felt compelled to make art in what he calls "downcast and brokenhearted" places. It's a drive born from an unshakable belief that his talents are a God-given mandate to ease the pain of others.

## Starting at a young ravaged

As a teen, he turned to art and faith to cope with tough times at home.

He opened his own shop in the Sacramento suburbs in 1996, and the business grew quickly. Shanghai Disney and Universal Studios Hollywood were among his clients. He was doing all the sales, bringing in all the work, managing dozens of employees. But he wasn't the one making the art, and it was soul-crushing.

In 2016, he shut down his shop and moved to Southern California to freelance for theme parks. Without the overwhelming responsibilities that come with running a business, he could also pursue passion projects outside of the commercial world.


For the past view years he'd been thinking a lot about art installations that incorporated manufactured ruins. Shane had binder full of mockups when the Camp Fire hit Paradise.

To him, this was a sign.

## Prior to the mural of Eleanor

Shane's first mural in Paradise took him about three hours to finish. The face of a woman with a weary, vulnerable look in her eyes had been brought to life with layers of opaque white and black spray paint bought in L.A. Arts District.

It was as if she had been burned into brick, forged by the fire. This was by design: Shane wanted the mural to blend into the environment, as if to acknowledge that this art would have never come to be if the flames hadn't been here first.
 Shane posted a photo of the chimney on his social media accounts that night, and a few people reacted. But when Shane Edwards, the owner of the property, shared the artwork on Facebook page for Camp Fire survivors, hundreds responded.

 "Love that there is something beautiful to look at in the midst of the devastation," one woman wrote.

 With the help of community members, Shane named the piece "Beauty Among the Ashes."

 It stood for seven weeks. But, it was eventually knocked down by an excavator.

 ## The perfect allegory

 He's now traveled to Paradise seven times to paint murals.

 Most of the murals have been variations of the first: beautiful women, by conventional standards. One was painted on the side of a rusted van, another on plastic  wrap stretched between two trees, overlooking a canyon.

 He is asked over and over again-why these women? Why here?

 They're an extension of a series he started over a decade ago called "The Bride," based on the love story "Song of Solomon" from the Bible.


To him, the story is an allegory for God's love of mankind. Just as the king loved the woman in this Bible passage unconditionally, so, too does God love the people of Paradise.
