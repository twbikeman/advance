# Ask Mr.Dad


## Q&A with parenting expert about some of today's common issues ##

## Bonding with tweens ##
Dear Mr. Dad: I am having difficult communicating with my 11-year-old son. He is completely uninterested in spending any more time with me than he has to. What can I do to build a better relationship with him.

A: Most parents struggle with exactly this issue as their children lurch forward into their adolescent years. The bad news is that most of the opportunities to get into trouble (sometimes serious or life-changing trouble) happen when children distance themselves from parents and look to their peers for guidance. Fortunately, there are still plenty of ways to bond with your children. Here are just four examples.

## Go to their level ##

Find out what your children love and try to get involved. Take them to concerts, movies, karate or video game tournaments, sporting events and everything else they show an interest in.  The more positively you respond to your child's interest and the less judgmental you are, the more time they'll want to spend with you.

## Bring them to your level ##

Expose your children to the things you love to do and give them a chance to experience your world. That might mean listening to classic rock, going fishing, going to a museum or anything else. Bringing your kids into your world tell them that you think they're good enough, smart enough and loved enough to be at your side in "grown-up" activities. That's a show of respect they'll never forget.

## Discover something new together ##

The thrill of exploration happens naturally and build a bond of friendship similar to what your children have with their closet peers. You might just discover a new interest or hobby that'll end up being a special activity for just the two of you.

## Go camping ##

Camping out under the stars is one of the most bonding experiences you can enjoy with your children. There's a reason so many programs for at-risk youth happen in the outdoors.

## The benefits of sports

Dear Mr. Dad: You've talked a lot about kids and sports. Why are sports are so important?

A: Kid these days have it tougher than we did when we were their age. Today's kids live in a world where social media puts every aspect of their lives under a harsh microscope--something we and our parents and grandparents never experienced. One of the most effective solutions to so many of the problems that affect young people these days rarely comes up: sports.

Sports teaches kids valuable skills in communication, cooperation, teamwork, goal-setting, problem-solving, learning to lose, resilience, respect for authority, controlling their emotions, patience, self-sacrifice and more, says Graham Clark, retired high-school football coach.

Those are skills that a lot of children--particularly those who grow up in dysfunctional situations (often those in which there is no father or father figure to teach those lessons)--don't learn. Children growing up without a father or strong father figure in their life are more likely to act out in school, be expelled, abuse drugs or alcohol and wind up in jail.

One of the best ways to support our children's participation in sports is to encourage coaches to build personal relationships with their athletes, especially those who are coping with challenges at home. Having a coach in their corner makes a huge difference. We've all heard famous athletes talk about how getting involved in sports and being taken under the wing of a good coach helped them overcome the challenges they faced at home.

"Most of the important people in my life were called 'coach,'" says Clark, who came from a broken home and had few role models.
